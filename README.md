## SMART SHEETS 
This app was developed to make the mind-numbingly slow and traditionally wasteful 
practice of producing and printing callsheets for phyiscal productions a thing of the past. 

Version 1 of this application allows for editable and sustained state data in the call sheet form. 

Version 2 is under development and will include the following feature updates: 

- Unified callsheet and productions relational model page
- User collaborators for group editing and call sheet email list generation 
- Templates for call sheets so your productions callsheets can be unique
